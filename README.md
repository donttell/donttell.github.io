## Please donâ€™t just say "I have something to tell you", "Can I tell you something", or "We need to talk".

There's a chance you were sent this by someone within Discord, Slack, IRC or another chat, after having started a conversation by just saying "I have something to tell you", "We need to talk", or any such similar statements, & have been waiting for a response.

You're likely curious what they tried to tell you with this link...

### Have I done something wrong?
It may have been unintentional, but questions like this serve as no more than a nuisance.

**Don't tell me you're going to tell me, just tell me.**

Starting conversations this way artificially lengthens the conversation. It may also stress one or both participants.

Worst case, you intended to have your recipient do the talking for you, or to ensure they cannot opt-out of the conversation without prior knowledge on the subject.

### Prior informing someone you have intentions to tell them something is unproductive.
### It can go one of a few ways.
### 1
- Person A says "I have to tell you something".
- Person B must now ask what this inevitable question is. (it would have occurred regardless)
- Person B must now wait for a response that might not even occur any time soon.
- Person B may experience stress. Lose productivity awaiting a response or speaking for you.
- Person A may respond, but because the interaction required active communication, it took several hours, or days.

### 2
- Person A says "I have to tell you something".
- Person B ignores the request awaiting an actual message with content.
- Person A gets frustrated. Places blame on Person B

### 3
- Person A says "We need to talk".
- Person A may announce intentions to speak, but in the future. Not right now.
- Person B asks.
- Person A does not respond.
- Person B is now stressed.

### 4
- Person A says "We need to talk, later". (Artificially delayed.) (Seriously, don't do this one.)
- Person B is stressed. (If you, Person B, are spiteful, respond with a "Yes we do". If you're stressed, they're stressed. Fair is fair.)

Informing someone that you intend to discuss something later places the entire burden of the subject upon the recipient, & perhaps the burden of bringing the subject up again, should you have forgotten about it.

It is nothing but a source of stress for the recipient.

- Person A says "Can I tell you something?"

This is the problem with "We need to talk l" & "[Don't ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com)" combined into one. Twice as problematic.
